# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
= my first time using javascript to create a project .

= the functions was hard in the bigging but at the end of project become very understandable.

= i googled the last 20% of the project because of the lack understanding of calling a functions inside a function for the "Repeating Rounds".

= in the end im happy on how much i learned and i will redo the project to see if i can complete it faster
